description: >-
  Toshi Moto is a watch-only Bitcoin wallet designed for secure portfolio monitoring and transaction tracking.

  Key Features:
  • Import your extended public key (Xpub) to monitor multiple Bitcoin addresses simultaneously
  • Real-time balance aggregation across all your wallets and addresses
  • Comprehensive transaction history and monitoring capabilities
  • Privacy-focused: All data remains local to your browser - no sensitive information is transmitted to servers
  • Read-only security: Cannot spend or sign transactions, ensuring your funds remain safe

  Core Principles:
  • Privacy First: Zero analytics or tracking. Your Xpub and transaction data never leave your browser. The backend only collects historical Bitcoin price data from CoinGecko.
  • Complete Transparency: Open-source code available at https://github.com/toshimoto821/toshi-moto under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license
  • Educational Focus: Designed to help users understand Bitcoin fundamentals while providing practical portfolio management tools

  Perfect for Bitcoin enthusiasts who want to monitor their holdings securely without compromising privacy or security.
